  +The purpose of this analysis was to try to replicate their estimate. Using the same San Francisco Chronicle’s aerial photographs our estimate rounded to the nearest thousand was 60386 compared to San Francisco Chronicle estimate of 65,000. Below you can find the methods used to construct our estimate along with a
discussions on potential limitations of the data/findings.
